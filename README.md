This repository stores the files for a project undertaken for the course ISSS608- Visual Analytics offered in SMU MITB


## Setup
As the datafiles are huge and cannot be uploaded to the repository, please download the datafiles from the following sources:
- [ACLED](https://www.acleddata.com/) : 
	-The armed conflict dataset was downloaded from ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project). For this project, the analysis was focused on Southern Asia during a 4 year period (Jan 2016 to Dec 2019)
- [GADM](https://gadm.org/data.html) : The geopackages that map the administrative areas of Southern Asia countries (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, India) were downloaded from the database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM)


Once the datafiles are loaded, please run the script in `PrepareDataFiles.R` to prepare the required RDS files that will be used in the other R scripts.
